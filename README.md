bootcamp in Full Stack Ruby on Rails, with the aim of improving my skills and expanding my knowledge, even though I am already an experienced Ruby on Rails engineer. I believe that continuous learning is essential to keep up with new trends and best practices in technology, as well as improving my ability to develop more complete and efficient solutions. This intensive program allows me to delve deeper into aspects that go beyond backend development, also covering frontend, service integration and modern web development practices.
